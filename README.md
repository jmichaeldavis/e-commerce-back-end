E-commerce Back End
# Description
This project is solely a back end appplication. A front end interface is not included. It allows the user to create various queries using Sequelize to manage a database for an e-commerce company's inventory.

# Installation and Usage
To use this, the user must do 'npm i' to install the packages, run the schema.sql file in mysql to add the database. Then run 'npm run seed' to add all the seeded data. Afterwards, running 'node server.js' will launch the server. The user can then test the queries using the Insomnia application.

# Contributing
